# MSCI-342-Project
## Project Description
<!-- 
Purple Pages will allow users to create an account as either a landlord or renter and to sign in to an existing account for returning users. Renters will enter their personal and contact information, answering questions about their living habits to provide more details for other potential housemates. The questions about living habits would focus on preferences, like sleep schedule and social activity. Renters can search for other renters by filtering for profile details such as gender, living habits, and interests. Renters can also search for rental postings with filters such as city, price, and number of rooms. For any rental posting, renters can mark themselves as “interested” on them and see a list of all other interested renters and their profiles. The renters can access a page that displays all rental postings they marked as "interested". Landlords will enter personal information and contact information when creating accounts. Landlord profiles can create rental postings. Each posting will include details about the lease and the landlord's contact information to allow renters to reach out to them. Rental postings, renter profiles, and landlord profiles can be edited, including closing rental postings that are no longer available.
